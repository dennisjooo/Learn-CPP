# Learn C++ Tutorials

These are some of my notes fo [Learn C++](https://learncpp.com), most of it are in comments (at not really the recommended kind but whatever). I am currently still going through it, and aiming to finish chapters by the end of July 2023. I will be updating this repo as I go through the chapters.

My aim in studying from the site is to gain a better understanding of C++ and have it in my pocket if I ever need more performance compared to Python. Previously I've dabbled with some [BroCode's Youtube tutorials](https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI), though I find the tutorials very easy to grasp and the exercises fun, I'm guessing that the content in the videos are not enough to get me to a level where I can confidently say that I know C++.

Overall I find this site to be a great resource for learning C++ and is relatively beginner friendly for the first ten or so chapters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking to learn C++. Thanks Alex, you are a great teacher of the masses!
