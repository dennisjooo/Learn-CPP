# Learn C++ Tutorials

These are some of my notes fo [Learn C++](https://learncpp.com), most of it are in comments (at not really the recommended kind but whatever). I finished it in July of 2023, things might have change since (especially iirc the last few chapters). I'm not sure if I'll ever get back to this but I'll leave it here for now.

My aim in studying from the site is to gain a better understanding of C++ and have it in my pocket if I ever need more performance compared to Python. Previously I've dabbled with some [BroCode's Youtube tutorials](https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI), though I find the tutorials very easy to grasp and the exercises fun, I'm guessing that the content in the videos are not enough to get me to a level where I can confidently say that I know C++.

Overall I find this site to be a great resource for learning C++ and is relatively beginner friendly for the first ten or so chapters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking to learn C++. Thanks Alex, you are a great teacher of the masses!
